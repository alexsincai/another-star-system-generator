# Yet Another Star System Generator

A simple star system generator, written in JavaScript, with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) for the pretty visuals.

The systems are not physically accurate (or even plausible), but it doesn't matter.

This is the React-less version, about a tenth of the size of the React version.
