# Another Star System Generator

A simple star system generator, written in JavaScript, with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (probably unneeded) for the layout and such, and [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/), [Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) for the pretty visuals.

The systems are not physically accurate (or even plausible), but it doesn't matter.
